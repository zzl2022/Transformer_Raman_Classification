# Transformer_Raman_Classification

Transformer and Raman spectroscopy enable a new diagnosis method for COVID-19

Dataset:
You need to manually complete the following operations. 
Create a new "data" folder under the project folder. 
Download the "Raman spectroscopy for detecting covid-19" data set from Kaggle and unzip it to the "data" folder. 
Dataset URL:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sfran96/raman-spectroscopy-for-detecting-covid19

Steps： Run classification_Transformer.py. Some results can be seen in the “result” folder which is generated by script.

Environment:
Python 3.7，requirements.txt
